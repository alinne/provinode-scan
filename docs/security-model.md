# Security Model (M1)

- Pairing uses short code + nonce generated by desktop receiver.
- Trust records are persisted locally with peer device ID + certificate fingerprint hash.
- Stream transport uses QUIC + TLS 1.3 with pinned-fingerprint verification hooks in the client.
- Every sample payload is SHA-256 hashed before recording and streaming.
