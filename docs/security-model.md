# Security Model (M1)

- Pairing uses short code + nonce generated by desktop receiver.
- Desktop pairing endpoint discovery uses mDNS advertisement with non-sensitive metadata only.
- Pairing request uses HTTPS with desktop cert fingerprint pinning from mDNS metadata.
- Pairing lockout is enforced by desktop after repeated invalid codes.
- Trust records are persisted locally with peer device ID + certificate fingerprint hash.
- Stream transport uses QUIC + TLS 1.3 with pinned-fingerprint verification in the client.
- Secure-channel hello now carries scanner device identity + fingerprint and is validated against desktop trust registry.
- Resume checkpoints and backpressure hints are exchanged on encrypted control payloads.
- Every sample payload is SHA-256 hashed before recording and streaming.
